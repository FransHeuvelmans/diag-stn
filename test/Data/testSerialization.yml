# sample yaml description of Graph

# First an overview of all the vertices used (loads in id, so check that !)
# note that the names need to be strings
vertices:
    -   name: '0'
        id: 0
    -   name: '1'
        id: 1
    -   name: '2'
        id: 2
    -   name: '3'
        id: 3
    -   name: '4'
        id: 4
    -   name: '5'
        id: 5
    -   name: '6'
        id: 6

# Next are the edges for the graph connecting the vertices with added bounds
# uses the id of the start and end nodes!
edges:
    -   start: 0
        end: 1
        lb: 10
        ub: 15
    -   start: 1
        end: 2
        lb: 14
        ub: 23
    -   start: 2
        end: 3
        lb: 6
        ub: 12
    -   start: 2
        end: 4
        lb: 13
        ub: 999
    -   start: 3
        end: 5
        lb: 25
        ub: 33
    -   start: 4
        end: 6
        lb: 10
        ub: 15

# Finally an _optional_ block for Observations
# (For now always use it because after the yaml is given by commandline it is processed immideately)
# Again uses the id for start and end nodes!
observations:
    -   start: 0
        end: 5
        lb: 85
        ub: 100
    -   start: 0
